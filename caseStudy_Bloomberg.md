# Bloomberg Case Study 
<img src="og-image-generic-lp.png" width="20%">

 A United States based, privately owned financial technology company focusing on financial information services.

## History

* In 1981, the company was launched by founder Michael Bloomberg, along with his partners, Thomas Seconda, Duncan Macmillan and Charles Zegar.

* That same year, Thompson-Reuters unveiled the Reuters Monitoring Dealing Service, which was the world’s first video terminal that allowed traders to execute trades over a video interface.

* In 1982, Bloomberg hired a team of programmers to develop and build the Innovative Marketing System (IMS). 

* Merrill Lynch was the only Wall Street company that showed interest in this new product, and provided Bloomberg with their initial funding.

* In 1984, however, Merrill Lynch agreed to let Bloomberg sell IMS to its competitors, and in 1986 IMS was officially renamed and incorporated as Bloomberg L.P. Over the next decades, Bloomberg expanded their business to include a variety of analytic and media products, and continues to innovate across multiple financial technology domains. 


Before Bloomberg developed his terminal, the financial information space was dominated by Reuters, Telerate and Dow Jones.  These companies followed a business model that focused on the technology managers, who were the purchasers of software and hardware, and who required standardized systems to provide news and price information in real time.  Bloomberg’s great innovation was to shift the focus from the technology managers to the traders, who were the ones actually engaged in the business of conducting financial transactions.  Bloomberg also understood the value of time and speed when making real time market decisions, and designed a system to specifically give traders a terminal with keyboards labeled with familiar and frequently used financial terms.  By shifting the business focus from the purchasers to the users, Bloomberg was able to create a disruption in the financial analysis and real-time market data space, and assume a long-standing role as a leader in this industry.

### Founders:

1. Michael Bloomberg
2. Thomas Seconda
3. Duncan Macmillan
4. Charles Zegar

## Business Activities:

Bloomberg realized that it was the traders and financial analysts who were making the rapid and substantially significant decisions that either lead to a gain or loss of millions of dollars every day.  In his knowledge of financial markets and trader behavior, Bloomberg also understood that profit in trading is made from finding disparity in information and data, and that traders must make very quick decisions during trading hours when every second can mean the difference between profit and loss.  Therefore, in order to address the problem of meeting the necessity to make extremely rapid trading decisions, Bloomberg designed his system to provide traders with easy access to functionalities that they require to do their job.

In order to address the specific function of rapid and convenient analysis to facilitate quick execution of live trades, Bloomberg designed a system with an easy-to-use terminal and a keyboard that was labeled with all the necessary financial terms that traders require to do their job.  The terminal system also had two to six monitors so that traders could see all the information that they needed simultaneously.  The built-in analytic capabilities were also available with simply the press of a button.  This was a unique innovation in the financial information space, since it allowed traders with a complete terminal system to facilitate their trading and analytic daily activities.

* The company’s intended customers are financial analysts and traders who require quick and easy access to market data and analytic tools.
* As of 2016, there are 325,000 Bloomberg terminal subscribers world-wide.
* Bloomberg’s main competitor at this time is Thomson Reuters, splitting 30% each of the market share as of a 2011 report.
* The Bloomberg terminal consists of a client-server architecture.
* The original terminal was developed using Fortran and C, but recent iterations have implemented C, C++, and Python.
* Almost all the Bloomberg terminal software and hardware is proprietary.

## Landscape:

Bloomberg Professional Services is a large, incumbent financial technology company that falls into the data analytics and enterprise solutions domains of the financial industry.  More broadly, Bloomberg Professional services is a financial data vendor, which provides market data to investors, traders, analysts and financial firms.  Market data is an approximately 25 billion dollar industry, with Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg holding an almost even market share of 30% each.  Besides Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, other companies in this domain include Dow Jones, Capital IQ, Fidessa, and Money.Net. Current innovations in this domain focus on automation and the use of artificial intelligence to optimize the delivery of data, as well as improvements in integration into the mobile space, to allow customers to access their data feeds through their mobile devices.

## Results:

Bloomberg has made a significant business impact in the market data domain of financial technology.  By switching the focus from technology managers to traders as the end-user customer, Bloomberg’s business model empowered traders to force the managers to purchase the terminals, leading to Bloomberg holding a large share of the market.  Using market-share as a metric of success, it is fair to say that holding 30% of the market is an indicator of Bloomberg’s success as a financial technology company.  Reuter’s is Bloomberg’s main competitor, also holding 30% of the market share.

## Recommendations

Bloomberg, with its ubiquitous terminal, has established itself as the dominant force in the market data sector of financial technology.  Moving forward, I would recommend that Bloomberg look into expanding and adjusting their terminal to better suit small, private investors.  Currently, the Bloomberg terminal remains an enterprise solution.  However, developing a private consumer version of the terminal could allow Bloomberg to penetrate into a different sub-sector of financial technology.  Allowing private investors to have a version of the terminal would create a new stream of revenue for the company, while empowering individuals to make better, data-driven investment decisions.
